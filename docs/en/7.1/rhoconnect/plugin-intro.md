RhoConnect Plugins Introduction
===

Rhoconnect Plugins allow you to connect your backend apps seamlessly with rhoconnect. You can write the source (query, create, update and delete operations) into a backend application, and use a RhoConnect plugin in the language that matchs your backend application, such as Java or .NET.

**NOTE: When you create a RhoConnect Plugin to connect your backend apps, you should not create a corresponding RhoConnect source adapter. RhoConnect Plugins do not use RhoConnect source adapters.**

**NOTE: Instead of using RhoConnect Plugins to connect particular backend applications (such as for Salesforce or Oracle), you can generate a [RhoConnect source adapter](source-adapters) which contains the query, create, update and delete operations.**
