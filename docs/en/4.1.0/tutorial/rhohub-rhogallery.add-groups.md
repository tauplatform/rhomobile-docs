RhoHub Gallery and RhoGallery Tutorial
========

You can create groups and add consumers to those groups. For example, you may wish to have a group for sales consumers, and another group for engineers. Also, you can add these groups to other galleries. For example, if you create a new gallery, you can add the sales group from your original gallery to your new gallery.

To create a group, go to the Consumers section in your gallery by clicking on Consumers.

In the Consumers section, click the Create Group button.

In the Add new Group pop-up window, enter the name for your group, then click Create Group.

Now you can add consumers to the group. Click on Add Consumer.

In the Add Consumers pop-up window, under the New Consumers tab, you can add a new consumer to your group by entering a login name and consumer name, and entering your consumer's email address to notify by email, or cell phone number if you notify by SMS. (This is the same process you would use when you add a consumer from the Gallery section.) Then click Invite.

Under the Existing Consumer tab, you see a list of consumers whom you have added to your gallery. To add these consumers to your group, check the checkbox for those consumers. Then click Invite.

Those consumers are added to the group.

Now add the group to your gallery. In the Galleries section, click on the Invite button, as you did when you invited consumers to the gallery.
