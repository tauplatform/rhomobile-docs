RhoHub Gallery and RhoGallery Tutorial
========

You also need consumers for your app. Consumers can use the RhoGallery mobile app to receive your app from your RhoHub gallery, and install it on their mobile device.

From your gallery, click the Invite button.

In the Invite Consumers pop-up window, enter a login name for your consumer, your consumer's name, and check the checkboxes to notify the consumer via email, or SMS, or both. Enter your consumer's email address if you notify by email; enter your consumer's cell phone number if you notify by SMS. You can also enter groups you want your consumer to be in; if the group does not exist yet, this will create the group.

You will see the consumer added to your gallery.

The consumer will receive an email, or an SMS, or both, similar to the following:
