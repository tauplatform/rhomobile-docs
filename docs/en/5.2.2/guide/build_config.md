# Build time configuration
Build time settings are dictated by a file in your app directory called `build.yml`. By default, this file has the most commonly used settings and some defaults that will work fine for most platforms. However, you may need to modify it at certain points. For example, if you need to build for an iOS device, you'll need to change the iphone: sdk: section to use an `iphoneos` SDK instead of an `iphonesimulator` SDK. Other special requirements apply to building for Android. 

This doc will provide guidelines and examples for modifying the `build.yml` file without jeopardizing your app.

## Default build.yml Settings
When you create your app, a default version of the build.yml file will be generated and it will look like this:

    :::yaml
    #sdk: "/path/to/rhodes_gem"
    sdkversion: 5.0.0
    name: My RhoMobile App
    version: 1.0
    vendor: rhomobile
    build: debug
    applog: rholog.txt
    iphone:
      configuration: Release
      sdk: iphonesimulator7.0
      provisionprofile:
      codesignidentity: iPhone Developer
      entitlements: ""
      BundleIdentifier: com.rhoappbuildersinc.myrhodesapp
      BundleURLScheme: buildymltest
    wp8:
      productid: '4ff21ee0-8ef1-0132-ec69-7831c1c374dc'
    android:
      manifest_template: 'AndroidManifest.erb'
      version: 2.3.3
    wm:
      #sdk: "MC3000c50b (ARMV4I)"
      #sdk: "Windows Mobile 6.5.3 Professional DTK (ARMV4I)"

    extensions: ["rhoconnect-client"]

## Capabilities
There are two ways of modifying your app's capabilities:

* Direct Edit - Just open the file and edit it.
* RhoStudio Modification - The RhoStudio IDE provides a GUI for modifying the capabilities using check-boxes.

### Direct edit
You can easily change specific settings in your build.yml file by simply opening it in you favorite text editor and modifying the text.

To enable specific device capabilities, edit your application's build.yml as follows:

    :::yaml
    capabilities:
      - camera
      - gps
    android:
      capabilities:
        - network_state

Rhodes support common plus platform-specific capabilities. They are merged into a single list at build time.

> Note: Only Android currently recognizes these platform-specific configuration options. Enabling these options across other platforms is planned for a future release.

List of supported capabilities:

* **audio** allows use of audio hardware (record audio, modify audio settings)
* **camera** allows use of hardware camera
* **gps** allows use of geo location service
* **network_state** allows read device network state (connected/disconnected)
* **phone** allow make calls/read phone state
* **pim** allow read/modify personal information and contacts
* **push** allows use of PUSH on device
* **record_audio** allows the recording of audio ('audio' implies it)
* **vibrate** allows use of hardware vibration mechanism
* **bluetooth** allows use of bluetooth hardware
* **calendar** allows access to default device calendar
* **sdcard** allows writing to the SD card on Android devices

## Windows Mobile/CE-specific Settings
You can specify where the `config.xml` file will reside on your device using the `config:` option.

    :::yaml
    wm:
      rhoelements:
        config: "/Config/Config.xml"

* config : path to the custom [Config.xml](runtime_config#configxml) file to use. This path is relative to the RhoMobile Project.

## Android-specific Settings
The capabilities listed above are directly related to the Android device capabilities that your app will require, and for which the user will be asked to give permission when installing the app. You can add capabilities to your Android app by adding a `capabilities` section to your build.yml in the android heading as such:

    :::yaml
    android:
        capabilities:
          - hardware_acceleration
        mapping: yes
        extensions:
          - gmaps

* **hardware_acceleration** enables hardware_acceleration for Android applications
* **mapping** enables the use of mapping apps
* **gmaps extension** enables the use of Google maps for mapping 

NOTE: To play embedded video, some versions of Android require hardware acceleration.

In RhoStudio, you can double-click on your application's `build.yml` and edit from the text editor, or edit it directly using a text editor of your choosing.

RhoMobile 5.2.2 will build successfully with Android versions up to and including Android 5.1 (Android L). **For Android builds, please install an Android SDK with API level 22 or lower**. For information about Android API levels, please visit the [Android API documentation](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels). 

The Android SDK allows you to programatically specify an application's compatibility with one or more versions of the Android platform using an API-Level integer. **The API Level can be specified in the `AndroidManifest.erb`, which must then be specified in the `build.yml`** (see sample, below). Android versions specified here will be compared to that of a given Android target device. 

The **syntax for the Android `<uses-sdk>` parameter**: 


    :::Ruby
    <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="integer"
          android:targetSdkVersion="integer"
          android:maxSdkVersion="integer" />

For more information about this parameter, please visit the [Android uses-sdk page](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html).  


### RhoStudio Modification
You can also edit the capabilities that your app will have access to through RhoStudio. To do this, double click your build.yml in your app's project in the project explorer pane in RhoStudio.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.tau-technologies.com/images/rhodocs/guide/build_config/open-build-yml-4.1.png)

Once you have done this, you should see the following screen wherein you can modify your build.yml settings, mainly, the capabilities.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.tau-technologies.com/images/rhodocs/guide/build_config/build-yml-edit-window-4.1.png)

Click the add button next to the capabilities field to bring up this window and add capabilities by clicking the corresponding check-box.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.tau-technologies.com/images/rhodocs/guide/build_config/select-capabilities-rhostudio-none-selected-4.1.png)![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.tau-technologies.com/images/rhodocs/guide/build_config/select-capabilities-rhostudio-camera-and-bt-4.1.png)

You'll notice that as you add capabilities to your app, the build.yml text file will change to reflect these added capabilities.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.tau-technologies.com/images/rhodocs/guide/build_config/added-capabilities-in-build-yml-4.1.png)

## RhoGallery Security Token

To restrict access to the application you may have it built with a security token. Specify the security token in the build.yml and build the app. Apps built with a security token can be started in normal mode only if you provide this token as a parameter.
If you do not specify the correct security token in the start params, the app will close on start by default. If you want do something instead of exit (for example show special message or run application in limited mode etc.) you can define another start_path for your application in "rhoconfig.txt":

    :::term
    invalid_security_token_start_path = '/app/InvalidSecurityTokenStartPage'

Specify security token in build.yml:

    :::yml
    security_token: 123

Run application with special parameter:

    :::ruby
    System::run_app( 'app_name', "security_token=123" )

## Rhobuild.yml Configuration
After installing the RhoMobile Suite, you must tell the software where you have certain files on your machine. To do this, we generate a bunch of default setting in a file called rhobuild.yml. Below is the default appearance of that file:

    :::yaml
    env:
      paths:
        java: "C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_11/bin"
        android: "C:/Android/sdk"

        vcbuild: "C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0/VC/vcpackages/vcbuild.exe"
    build:
      wmpath: "platform/wm"
      wp8path: "platform/wp8"
      androidpath: "platform/android"
      iphonepath: "platform/iphone"
    android:
    excludedirs:
      all:
    # Google API key obtained from http://code.google.com/intl/en/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html

### Modifying rhobuild.yml settings
To modify these settings, there are two methods:

1. Modify these settings in the properties of RhoStudio.
2. Modify the rhobuild.yml file directly.
    * On Mac OS X, the file resides in `\rhodes\<version>`
    * On Windows, the file resides in  `\RhoMobileSuite`
