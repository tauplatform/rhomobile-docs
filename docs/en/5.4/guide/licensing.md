# Licensing
Licensing in RMS 5.x has changed considerably. Most significant is the requirement to maintain a subscription to [rhomobile.com](http://www.rhomobile.com) before building any app. While you can still build an unlimited number of local apps for free, pricing models apply for cloud-based builds and for most apps that will use RhoConnect or RhoElements. 

## Subscriptions
Zebra's new subscription licensing model offers three levels: Free, Silver and Gold. The the plans are detailed below.

NOTE: The free subscription is limited to local builds using Rhodes and RhoStudio only.

## Applying Your Subscription Plan
Once you have signed up for a subscription on [rhomobile.com](http://www.rhomobile.com/content/rhopricing.html), you'll need to apply your new plan to your copy of RhoStudio. This can be done through the IDE or the command line. Either method allows the registered user to sign into their rhomobile.com account in advance or at build time. Both methods are detailed below. 

### Signing In With the Command Line
