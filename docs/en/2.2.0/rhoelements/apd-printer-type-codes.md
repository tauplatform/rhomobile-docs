# Zebra Adaptive Printer Driver - Print Type Codes

The Zebra Adaptive Printer Driver (APD) provides a simple, yet powerful, interface between your applications and virtually any portable printer.

## Overview

By means of simple commands that are independent of printer type and connection, the host application can print labels, receipts, or tags, without knowledge of the command language used by the printer, or the way the printer is linked to the hand- held terminal. Thus, printer types can be mixed, or a new type can be added – with the host sending the information in the same simple, ‘unified’ form.

The ‘key’ to the Adaptive Printer Driver is the “Printer ID” (PID) that identifies the type of printer, its command language, means of connection and other parameters, such as IP Address. Normally, the “Printer ID” is displayed in bar-coded form on a small label on the printer so that the user can transfer all the required parameters to the Zebra terminal, simply by scanning this label.

An example of the PID for a printer for use in a Wireless Local Area Network is shown below.

In this case, two barcodes, using “Code 128” symbology, are used to define the full PID.

The printer type is identified by characters 2, 3 and 4 in the upper barcode: in this example “C53”, which indicates a Zebra QL320 printer.

The first character “W” identifies the connection type as “Wireless Local Area Network” and “6101” indicates the TCP Port Number for this printer, preceded by a colon.

The IP address is encoded as 157235010002 to make the barcode more compact, but the APD will also accept the form containing ‘dots’. An address of “0.0.0.0” indicates that the printer uses a dynamically assigned address issued by a DHCP server.

The second example, below, is also based on the Zebra QL320 printer, but uses “Bluetooth” connectivity, which is indicated by the leading “B”.

“:1” indicates that the Bluetooth Channel Number is “1”.

The Bluetooth address, in the second barcode, is encoded as “0080371ABD79” to minimise the size of the barcode, but the APD will also accept the address with or without the ‘colons’.

Note 1: The APD will also accept the 5 digit ‘ID’ used by Toshiba-TEC printers. When this is entered, the APD will convert the 5 digit number to a 4 character hexadecimal code and assume “T” as the type code. This identifies the command language to be used, allowing data to be printed correctly. However, it does not allow the APD to determine the exact model of printer, so care needs to be taken in the naming of template and format files for these printers.
