## Known issues for JRuby:

* Usually JDK is shipped with only weak encryption, and that simply will not allow the proper key sizes being created by openssl. RhoConnect uses strong encryption for license keys and to function properly in JRuby environment installation of Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction policy files might be required.
* Path to userâ€™s gems, warbler data should not include white spaces (i.e. in user's account name).
